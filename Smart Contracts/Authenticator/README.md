The authenticator contractâ€™s role is to manage the terms under which a miner
can connect to the pools managed by the system. It acts on information provided by all
of the other contracts to determine if a miner is allowed to be connected to a pool. It
could function similarly to the EthereumSmartPool as a means of self governance for
willing participants in the pools. It should be noted that this is a form of censorship,
that a miner dis-authorized from connecting to a pool would be required to either
mine solo, or find another pool in the system from which it has not been blacklisted.
