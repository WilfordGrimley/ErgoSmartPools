The pool creation contract is intended to be self-replicable and interoperable
with other pools managed by the system if such metrics are defined in the creation of
the pool during crowdfunding. The pool collects data from connected miners’ oracles
as often as called for by the crowdfunding parameters to determine their share’s
submitted or hash rate of authorized miners. They should be able to be built both as
traditional pools within smart contracts like in Ethereum SmartPools, and with miners
mining solo, with the pools only acting as an intermediary for small payments being
made to miners.
