The proposal would require each miner to run an NiPoPoW 11 Ergo Oracle, whose
purpose is to record their accumulated shares submitted in the case of Autolykos v2, or
current hash rate and difficulty in the case of Autolykos with non-outsourceability re-
enabled. The data from these oracles could be aggregated on-chain and polled in
aggregate Oracles only as often as required the contracts that back the pool the miner
is connected to. Ethereum Smart Contracts provides a basis for data collection
standards that are economical and disincentivize cheating.
