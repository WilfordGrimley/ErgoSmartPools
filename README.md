# ErgoSmartPools

This project is currently in the design phase and welcomes contribution in all forms.


The aim of this project is to make obselete the need for traditional mining pools in Ergo. It will enable otherwise solo miners to receive a steady income, financially incentivize decentralization, and be 100% more transparent than traditional mining pools.

We achieve this by creating a few multistaged smart contracts to serve various purposes: 
## 
	Saturation Oracle,
	Crowdfunding,
	Authorization, 
	Saturation Enforcement,
	Daughter Pools.
	(Miner Payment will also likely need a dedicated pool to make the system more efficient) 
	


Lets breakdown how each smart contract is designed to work in the system.
